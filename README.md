# Fix My Code
These were a series of projects offered by ALX SE School, where I was tasked with
debugging various programs. These challenges encompassed a range of programming languages,
including C, Python, JavaScript, and more. While I had prior familiarity with some of these
languages, others were entirely new to me.
